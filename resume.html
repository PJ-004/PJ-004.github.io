                <p> Interned at QuicHub Innovations India as a Software Developer. Migrated their data from the older urql to GraphQL.

                <p> <h4> Freelance Work </h4> </p>
                <p> Developed a python script for a close relative that extracts the warnings from a System Verilog logfile.
                 The script searches through a log file and extracts warning messages from them after looping through every line.
                 This script required thorough knowledge of the python programming language.
                 It also drastically improved the workflow of the employees by automating an otherwise tedious task.
