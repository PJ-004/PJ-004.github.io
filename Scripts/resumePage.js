                <p> Interned at QuicHub Innovations India as a Software Developer. Migrated their data from the older urql to GraphQL.  \
                 I worked with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and GraphQL to help with designing their frontend software. \

                <p> Developed a python script for a close relative that extracts the warnings from a System Verilog logfile. \
                 The script searches through a log file and extracts warning messages from them after looping through every line. \
                 This script required thorough knowledge of the python programming language. \
                 It also drastically improved the workflow of the employees by automating an otherwise tedious task. </p>\
