# My Website
This is my personal website that I created using HTML/CSS and Javascript. I used to host another website on here before but that was just made to test my Javascript skills. The site is hosted through GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://pranavjha.org/)

## How it works
All the Javascript code is stored in the `/Scripts` directory. The main `index.html` file loads those scripts.

The scripts display which page to load. By clicking any of the buttons in the header, one of these scripts is activated, changing the body tag in the `index.html` file. `aboutPage.js` displays the 'About Me' page, `projectPage.js` shows my current projects, and `resumePage.js` shows my resume (i.e. the places I've worked at)

The afforementioned scripts use the `innerHTML` command to change the text of any body tag in the HTML file.

`displayDate.js` is used for displaying my age on first visiting the website, as well as the date on the top. It uses a Date object to find out your system's time.

## Hosting
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), however, I have now attached a domain name to it.

## Potential new features
I may add a way to download my resume instead of just linking to LinkedIn.

In the future, I may change this website to use stuff like React just to show my proficiency in it, although I do like pure Javascript quite a bit.
